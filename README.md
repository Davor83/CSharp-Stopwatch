## ⏱️ CSharp-Stopwatch

This is my first personal project built with C# and WPF.
It's a simple stopwatch application created to practice working with graphical user interfaces, event-driven programming, and time tracking logic.
The app includes start, stop, and reset functionality, and uses `DispatcherTimer` for precise time updates.
